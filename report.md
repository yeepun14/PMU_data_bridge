# Background
## Gewertz square project
Infrastructure Under Development: A RE100 Microgrid — a fully renewable energy-based power grid — composed entirely of power electronics-interfaced sources such as rooftop solar PV and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). In the event of a power outage within Chulalongkorn University, the microgrid will switch to islanding operation mode, operating independently to ensure high reliability and resilience of the electrical system in the Gewertz square buildings. 

The project involves connecting the microgrid to the main grid, which requires **synchronization** between the two systems. Therefore, it is necessary to **collect data in real time**.

### Grid and Microgrid Synchronization
Grid and Microgrid Synchronization refers to the process of aligning a microgrid's electrical parameters (such as Voltage, Frequency, and Phase angle) with those of the main utility grid to ensure safe and stable operation when connecting.

When a microgrid reconnects to the main grid (after operating in island mode) or shares power in grid-connected mode, the following conditions must match:
- Voltage magnitude
- Frequency
- Phase angle
- Phase sequence

If these don’t match, it can lead to:
- Power surges
- Equipment damage
- Unstable grid operation

### PMU in Grid–Microgrid Synchronization
Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) play a key role in ensuring safe and stable synchronization between a microgrid and the main grid. They provide time-synchronized, high-resolution measurements of voltage and current phasors, enabling accurate monitoring and control during grid transitions.

**Key Benefits of PMU Integration**
1. Time-Synchronized Data
PMUs use GPS-based time stamping to provide synchronized phasor data, essential for comparing voltage, frequency, and phase angle between the grid and microgrid.
2. Accurate Parameter Matching
Synchronization requires that voltage, frequency, and phase angle are closely aligned. PMUs enable real-time monitoring to ensure safe connection or reconnection.
3. Fast Fault Detection
With high reporting rates (30–120 samples/second), PMUs detect disturbances faster than traditional SCADA, allowing quicker responses to instability.
4. Support for Inverter Control
PMUs enhance the control of inverter-based microgrids by supporting advanced control strategies such as droop control and virtual synchronous operation.
5. Safe Reconnection & Black Start
PMUs facilitate seamless resynchronization after islanding or blackouts by tracking alignment conditions in real time.

### Lab Synchronization (Synchronous Generator)
Study the control of a synchronous generator connected to the power grid. It focuses on synchronization, real power control via mechanical torque, and reactive power control via field current. Key observations include power-angle characteristics and the V-Curve. The **"Dark Lamp Method"** is used for synchronization (A synchronization method using three lamps. When all go dark at once, the generator's voltage matches the grid — indicating the right moment to connect) ,with safety and proper meter usage emphasized.

Lab Simulation from https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/charles.joubert/web_anim/simen_Pelton_couplee_1.html

![Synchronized_summary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ca42d7c-28fe-4d93-92c9-b663df7cb976)

When all three lamps go dark simultaneously, it means the voltage from the generator is **equal** in magnitude, frequency, and phase to the grid. At that exact moment, the voltage difference is nearly zero, so **no current flows through the lamps** (I ≈ 0). This ensures a smooth connection without causing **inrush current, arcing, or mechanical stress**, which can damage the generator or system. Synchronizing at any other time would result in a phase mismatch and potentially large circulating currents.

![Synchronized_Lab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff1ef94a-3b76-484f-893b-13e09f9b8a23)

When all three lamps go dark simultaneously, it indicates that the voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase match. This is the correct moment to close the breaker and synchronize the generator, ensuring a smooth and safe connection without circulating current or electrical stress.

PMUs relates conceptually. The lab involves phasor-based analysis of voltage, current, and power in synchronous generators. PMUs are designed to measure in real-time. PMUs help monitor synchronization, stability, and power flow in large power systems, exactly the kind of behavior being studied in this experiment.

## Data Bridging project
This project is designed to bridge data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) to Redpanda. The goal is to **facilitate the transfer and processing** of PMU data in a real-time streaming environment.

### Overview
The data bridging process involves extracting PMU data, transforming it into a suitable format, and then loading it into Redpanda for real-time analytics and processing.

### Phasor measurement Units (PMUs)
PMUs measure values such as voltage (V), current (I), Frequency, and Phase angle in real time, and transmit the data using the IEEE C37.118 protocol — the primary standard for PMU data. The information is sent as a binary stream in a frame-based format.

From [microgridPMU](databridge/microgridPMU.py)

### Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC)
To collect and process synchrophasor data, two custom PDCs was developed. They receive real-time data from the microgrid PMU, align measurements to a 20 ms interval based on timestamp, and calculate both average and reactive power for each phase and the total power. The processed data is then forwarded to Redpanda for downstream analytics and visualization.

From [microgridPDC](databridge/microgridPDC.py) We use this code to collect data from microgrid PMU which is the generated data from [microgridPMU](databridge/microgridPMU.py) and produce message to Redpanda in topic "microgridPMU"

From [tinyPDC_udp](databridge/tinyPDC_udp.py) We use this code to collect data from grid PMU which get the real data from a PMU device and produce message to Redpanda in topic "gridPMU".


To align timestamp, we round the time to a 20 ms interval using this code
```
tstamp   = round(round(pmu_data["time"]/0.02) * 0.02, 2) 
```

To calculate average and reactive power of each phase and the total power, we use this function
```
def average_power(V_mag, V_ang_deg, I_mag, I_ang_deg):
    angle_diff_rad = math.radians(V_ang_deg) - math.radians(I_ang_deg)
    return V_mag * I_mag * math.cos(angle_diff_rad)
def reactive_power(V_mag, V_ang_deg, I_mag, I_ang_deg):
    angle_diff_rad = math.radians(V_ang_deg) - math.radians(I_ang_deg)
    return V_mag * I_mag * math.sin(angle_diff_rad)
                
Pa = average_power(m0["phasors"][0][0], m0["phasors"][0][1], m0["phasors"][1][0], m0["phasors"][1][1])
Pb = average_power(m1["phasors"][0][0], m1["phasors"][0][1], m1["phasors"][1][0], m1["phasors"][1][1])
Pc = average_power(m2["phasors"][0][0], m2["phasors"][0][1], m2["phasors"][1][0], m2["phasors"][1][1])
Qa = reactive_power(m0["phasors"][0][0], m0["phasors"][0][1], m0["phasors"][1][0], m0["phasors"][1][1])
Qb = reactive_power(m1["phasors"][0][0], m1["phasors"][0][1], m1["phasors"][1][0], m1["phasors"][1][1])
Qc = reactive_power(m2["phasors"][0][0], m2["phasors"][0][1], m2["phasors"][1][0], m2["phasors"][1][1])

P_total = Pa + Pb + Pc
Q_total = Qa + Qb + Qc
```

            - timescaledb   # Ensure TimescaleDB starts before Grafana
        ```
    - **Database**\
    This system collects and stores real-time PMU data using Kafka, Python, and TimescaleDB. PMU data is sent to a Kafka topic (gridPMU and microgridPMU), which is consumed by json_consumer_gridPMU.py and json_consumer_microgridPMU.py.The script extracts electrical measurements from each JSON message and inserts them into a TimescaleDB table (randomPMU3p) running in a Docker container.

    - **JSON Consumer form gridPMU**\
    This Python script acts as a Kafka consumer that subscribes to the topic "gridPMU" and receives real-time JSON-formatted PMU data. It parses each message, converts the timestamp to Bangkok time, and inserts the extracted data into a TimescaleDB table named randomPMU3p.

        ```
        - **Read messages from Kafka and insert into the database**\
        This code acts as a Kafka consumer that continuously listens for PMU data messages from the "gridPMU" topic. Each message is a JSON object containing various measurement values. The program extracts these values, converts the timestamp to Bangkok local time, and then inserts the data into a TimescaleDB table named randomPMU3p for further analysis and visualization.

    For [json_comsumer_gridPMU](databridge/json_comsumer_gridPMU.py)

    The code in this section works the same as in the JSON consumer gridPMU file, except that the Kafka topic is microgridPMU instead of gridPMU.

### Grafana
Grafana is used as the visualization tool to display PMU data stored in a PostgreSQL database. The data source is configured under the name PMU, and a custom SQL query is used to retrieve the most recent three-phase voltage data from two PMUs (pmu_id = 1 and 2). The query selects the latest values for each voltage magnitude (va_mag, vb_mag, vc_mag) and angle (va_ang, vb_ang, vc_ang.)
```
SELECT DISTINCT ON (pmu_id)
    pmu_id, time, va_mag, va_ang,
    vb_mag, vb_ang,
    vc_mag, vc_ang
FROM randompmu3p 
WHERE pmu_id IN (1, 2)
ORDER BY pmu_id, time DESC;
```
For visualization, the Plotly panel plugin is used with a polar coordinate chart to represent voltage phasors. The configuration includes conversion of angles from radians to degrees and plotting both PMU data sets on the same chart for comparison. Solid lines represent PMU 1 (VA, VB, VC) while dotted lines represent PMU 2 (VA2, VB2, VC2).

### System Design
We have divided the system into three separate PCs, each performing specific tasks according to the flowchart:

![Flowchart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24babc6-0878-498b-a049-43a8d84eabdd)

- **PC 1** collects data from two sources: the Microgrid PMU, which provides measurements of Voltage, Frequency, and Phase Angle, and the Grid PMU, which receives data from the utility grid. This PC functions as a data concentrator, converting raw PMU data into a more readable format and calculating Active power (P), Reactive power (Q), and Apparent power (S) for further analysis.

- **PC 2** is responsible for receiving the processed data from PC 1 (Redpanda). Moreover, it is the connected netwerk IP for PC 1 and PC 3 to collect data.

- **PC 3** stores the received data into a database and displays synchronized measurements through a Grafana Dashboard.

(It is not necessary to follow this design)

# Result

### 🔹 **Summary**
System successfully implemented a real-time data streaming system that bridges phasor measurements from grid and microgrid PMUs into a robust analytics pipeline.

**System overview :**
```
PMU Data Collection → PDC (20ms sync, P/Q calc) → Redpanda → TimescaleDB → Grafana Dashboard
```
### 🔹 **Demo**
Live Visualization using Grafana dashboards. (Auto-updates every 5 seconds, with potential for faster refresh via **Kafka** plugin integration but not stable.)

Three-phase voltage data from both PMUs can be shown as tables and time-series plots.
