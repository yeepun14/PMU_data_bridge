# background
This project is designed to bridge data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) to Redpanda. The goal is to **facilitate the transfer and processing** of PMU data in a real-time streaming environment.
### Overview
The data bridging process involves extracting PMU data, transforming it into a suitable format, and then loading it into Redpanda for real-time analytics and processing.

- ### Phasor measurement Units
A device used to measure the electrical parameters on an electricity grid in **real-time data**. It sends data over the network in IEEE C37.118 format.

- ### PDC ()
A device used to measure the electrical parameters on an electricity grid in **real-time data**. It sends data over the network in IEEE C37.118 format.

- ### Redpanda
A high-performance streaming platform that is designed for real-time data processing.

- ### TimescaleDB
A time-series database built on PostgreSQL that is suitable for real-time data ingestion and querying.
